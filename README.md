# Shadow-Search
A basic search engine in terminal that prints top 5 lings based upon your search input

This is a Python script for a search engine called "Shadow Search". The script includes a list of search engines with their URLs, classes, and attributes for finding search results. It then prompts the user for a search query, and searches for that query in each search engine in the list. If results are found in any engine, it prints the first five links for that query in that engine. If the query is not found in any engine, it prints a message indicating that no results were found. The script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries for web scraping, and determines the default browser for the current platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux) using the platform library.
